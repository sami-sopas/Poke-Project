# Poke Project

In the context of the theory of automata, this project is presented as a finite state machine which is a mathematical model, represented with formal resources  that can be used to represent or simulate the operation of a real system.  

In this case it will be computational and will be very useful, since the formal design can be easily implemented through a program written in this case in C++ language.
